# because coping the full disk with dd over network resulted a broken image
# from a virtio drive, so here is another option: archive the while system
# with tar, with preserving the file ownership and permissions

cd /
shopt -s extglob
tar --same-owner -czvp !(dev|proc|run|sys) | nc remote_server remote_port


#remote server:
nc -l -p remote_port > server.disk.tar.gz


#list file (even in an incomplete tar)
tar -ztvf server.disk.tar.gz
